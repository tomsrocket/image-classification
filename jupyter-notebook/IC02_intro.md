# Image classification with Python, or how I won a hackathon

## The Library

### scikit-learn - "Machine Learning in Python"

* Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
* Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
* Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
* Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

#### Numpy 
* support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
* library of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
* more efficient operations on arrays than the CPython standard implementation

#### SciPy
* scientific computing and technical computing
* modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE
* builds on the NumPy array object 

#### Matplotlib
* plotting library for Python and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. 
* object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications 
* procedural "pylab" interface designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB

----- 

#### pandas
* built on top of NumPy
* extra tool that provides a more streamlined way of working with numerical and tabular data 
* time series functionality, data alignment, NA-friendly statistics, groupby, merge and join methods, 
* popular for financial applications

#### SymPy
* Python library for symbolic computation
